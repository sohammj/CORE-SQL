# System Requirements

## Compiler Requirements
- C++17 compatible compiler:
  - GCC 7.0 or higher
  - Clang 5.0 or higher
  - MSVC 19.14 or higher (Visual Studio 2017 version 15.7 or later)
- CMake 3.10 or higher (for building)

## System Requirements
- Operating System: 
  - Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+)
  - macOS 10.13+
  - Windows 10+
- RAM: 2GB minimum, 4GB+ recommended
- Storage: 50MB free space for installation, plus space for databases
- CPU: Dual-core processor minimum

## Dependencies
- Standard C++ Libraries only
- No external database libraries required
- No third-party dependencies

## Build Tools (Optional)
- Make (for Unix-based systems)
- Ninja (alternative build system)
- Git (for version control)

## Developer Tools (Optional)
- GDB or LLDB for debugging
- Valgrind for memory analysis (Unix-based systems)
- Visual Studio Code or other IDE with C++ support

## Testing Requirements
- Googletest (for unit tests)
- CTest (integrated with CMake)

## Performance Guidelines
- Expected to handle up to 100,000 rows per table efficiently
- Transaction processing: ~1,000 transactions per second
- Query execution: Response time under 100ms for typical queries
- Memory usage: Scales with database size, approximately 2x the raw data size

## Scaling Limitations
- Maximum database size: Limited primarily by system memory and disk space
- Maximum table size: 2^32 rows (4.2 billion records)
- Maximum row size: 64KB
- Maximum columns per table: 256
- Maximum indexes per table: 64
- Maximum concurrent users: Depends on system resources, typically 100+

## Recommended Hardware for Production Use
- CPU: 4+ cores, 3.0+ GHz
- RAM: 8GB+
- Storage: SSD with 100GB+ free space
- Network: 1 Gbps Ethernet (for networked deployments)
